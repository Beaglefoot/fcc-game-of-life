# Conway's Game Of Life
The fourth project in React series on freeCodeCamp.

User Stories:
* When I first arrive at the game, it will randomly generate a board and start playing.
* I can start and stop the board.
* I can set up the board.
* I can clear the board.
* When I press start, the game will play out.
* Each time the board changes, I can see how many generations have gone by.

## Rules
* Life is played on a grid of square cells.
* Each cell can be either live or dead.
* A live cell is marked with color. A dead cell has an empty square.
* Each cell has 8 neighbor cells.
* A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors will be reborn and become a live cell.
* A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors stays alive.
* A live cell with only 1 live neighbor dies from isolation.
* A live cell with 4 or more live neighbors dies from overcrowding.
